I like to consider myself a multidisciplinary engineer who is currently focused on software development. Originally from Thailand, I moved to the Netherlands to continue my studies at the University of Twente, where I obtained a degree in Technology and Liberal Arts & Sciences. With a specialization in biomedical engineering, I strive to maintain a human-focused perspective in my works.  
 
Now based in Amsterdam, I am a developer at Digital Society School where I tinker with emerging technology, develop various digital tools, and design workshops and courses at the intersection of design, data, tech, and society. Next to that, I am a collaborator at AI x Design, a budding community that unites practitioners and develops practices at the intersection of AI and design.  
 
I am passionate about data strategy, computational art, and the philosophy of technology. I enjoy learning new things and playing around with ideas to explore new perspectives. When not tinkering or thinking too much, I'm either on the soccer field or on the search for good burgers. 

# My Philosophy

Curiosity, Creativity, Community.

**Finding the dots and connecting them.**

> “To stay eager, to connect, to find interest in the everyday, to notice what everybody else overlooks — these are vital skills and noble goals. They speak between looking and seeing, between hearing and listening, between accepting what the world presents and noticing what matters to you.”  
> <p align="right">- Rob Walker, The Art of Noticing</p>

The pursuit of truth is what keeps me curious. I strive to understand the world and the workings of our society. Truth comes in multiple forms - empirical, historical, emotional, theoretical. Truths combine to form new truths. Every being to each their own. Studying various disciplines, observing nature, appreciating art, talking to strangers — curiosity allows me to explore and find the dots which are the points of truth. 

With every knowledge and observation, I seek to find the connection. To draw the lines between the dots. To update my state of truth with every iteration of findings.

**Making the most with what we have.**

I believe that it is in our nature to create. It is an expression of self and individuality. Creativity drives us to make the most with what we have. Not what we will have or what we had, but what we have in this moment.

**Inspiring and lifting people up.**

I want to use my knowledge and skills to help people live better lives - to be kind (to themselves and others), to live authentically, and to unlock their full potential (in order to achieve their dreams and to contribute to the world).
